## About me

Currently I am working on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying complex behaviors at the [Chronobiology and Behavioural Neurogenetics Laboratory](https://www.clockclub.org/), JNCASR. My studies use diverse methodologies - from behavioral screening to whole-genome sequencing. I am trying to understand the genetic diversity that gives rise to different chronotypes in organisms, mainly through large-scale genomic deletion screening and pooled-sequencing. I am also interested in masking - a non-clock-dependent timing mechanism. I love to code, and my recent endeavors resulted in the development of two full-scale shiny apps for time-series analysis ([VANESSA](https://github.com/orijitghosh/VANESSA-DAM)).

Apart from my work in the lab, I am a serial chiller, leisure photographer, and connoisseur of sci-fi (old and new) and good food (I am rated a super foodie by Zomato)!
